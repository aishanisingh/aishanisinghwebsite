        <p>You probably meant to go to my actual website, <a href="https://aishani-singh.github.io/">aishani-singh.github.io</a>, instead of <a href="https://aishanisingh.github.io">aishanisingh.github.io</a>. You were just missing a hyphen, close enough! </p>
        <p>Don't worry, you'll be automatically redirected in a couple seconds.</p>
